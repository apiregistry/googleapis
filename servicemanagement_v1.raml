        description: |
          A version string for this api. If specified, must have the form
          `major-version.minor-version`, as in `1.10`. If the minor version
          is omitted, it defaults to zero. If the entire version field is
          empty, the major version is derived from the package name, as
          outlined below. If the field is not empty, the version in the
          package name will be verified to be consistent with what is
          provided here.

          The versioning schema uses [semantic
          versioning](http://semver.org) where the major version number
          indicates a breaking change and the minor version an additive,
          non-breaking change. Both version numbers are signals to users
          what to expect from different versions, and should be carefully
          chosen based on the product plan.

          The major version is also reflected in the package name of the
          API, which must end in `v<major-version>`, as in
          `google.feature.v1`. For major versions 0 and 1, the suffix can
          be omitted. Zero major versions must only be used for
          experimental, none-GA apis.

          For requests without credentials, if the service control environment is
          specified, each incoming request **must** be associated with a service
          consumer. This can be done by passing an API key that belongs to a consumer
          project.

      By default, if a method has any authentication requirements, every request
      must include a valid credential matching one of the requirements.
      It's an error to include more than one kind of credential in a single
      request.

      If a method doesn't have any auth requirements, request credentials will be

      Documentation is provided in markdown syntax. In addition to
      standard markdown features, definition lists, tables and fenced
      code blocks are supported. Section headers can be provided and are
      interpreted relative to the section nesting of the context where
      a documentation fragment is embedded.

      Documentation from the IDL is merged with documentation defined
      via the config at normalization time, where documentation provided
      by config rules overrides IDL provided.

      A number of constructs specific to the API platform are supported
      in documentation text.

      In order to reference a proto element, the following
      notation can be used:
      <pre><code>&#91;fully.qualified.proto.name]&#91;]</code></pre>
      To override the display text used for the link, this can be used:
      <pre><code>&#91;display text]&#91;fully.qualified.proto.name]</code></pre>
      Text can be excluded from doc using the following notation:
      <pre><code>&#40;-- internal comment --&#41;</code></pre>
      Comments can be made conditional using a visibility label. The below
      text will be only rendered if the `BETA` label is available:
      <pre><code>&#40;--BETA: comment for BETA users --&#41;</code></pre>
      A few directives are available in documentation. Note that
      directives must appear on a single line to be properly
      identified. The `include` directive includes a markdown file from
      an external source:
      <pre><code>&#40;== include path/to/file ==&#41;</code></pre>
      The `resource_for` directive marks a message to be the resource of
      a collection in REST view. If it is not specified, tools attempt
      to infer the resource from the operations in a collection:
      <pre><code>&#40;== resource_for v1.shelves.books ==&#41;</code></pre>
      The directive `suppress_warning` does not directly affect documentation
      and is documented together with service config validation.

      `Endpoint` describes a network endpoint that serves a set of APIs.
      A service may expose any number of endpoints, and all endpoints share the
      same service configuration, such as quota configuration and monitoring
      configuration.

      Example service configuration:

          name: library-example.googleapis.com
          endpoints:
            # Below entry makes 'google.example.library.v1.Library'
            # API be served from endpoint address library-example.googleapis.com.
            # It also allows HTTP OPTIONS calls to be passed to the backend, for
            # it to decide whether the subsequent cross-origin request is
            # allowed to proceed.
          - name: library-example.googleapis.com
            apis: google.example.library.v1.Library
            allow_cors: true
            # Below entry makes 'google.example.library.v1.Library'
            # API be served from endpoint address
            # google.example.library-example.v1.LibraryManager.
          - name: library-manager.googleapis.com
            apis: google.example.library.v1.LibraryManager
            # BNS address for a borg job. Can specify a task by appending
            # "/taskId" (e.g. "/0") to the job spec.

      `HttpRule` defines the mapping of an RPC method to one or more HTTP
      REST APIs.  The mapping determines what portions of the request
      message are populated from the path, query parameters, or body of
      the HTTP request.  The mapping is typically specified as an
      `google.api.http` annotation, see "google/api/annotations.proto"
      for details.

      The mapping consists of a field specifying the path template and
      method kind.  The path template can refer to fields in the request
      message, as in the example below which describes a REST GET
      operation on a resource collection of messages:

      ```proto
      service Messaging {
        rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
          option (google.api.http).get = "/v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}";
        }
      }
      message GetMessageRequest {
        message SubMessage {
          string subfield = 1;
        }
        string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
        SubMessage sub = 2;    // `sub.subfield` is url-mapped
      }
      message Message {
        string text = 1; // content of the resource
      }
      ```

      This definition enables an automatic, bidrectional mapping of HTTP
      JSON to RPC. Example:

      HTTP | RPC
      -----|-----
      `GET /v1/messages/123456/foo`  | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" sub: SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))`

      In general, not only fields but also field paths can be referenced
      from a path pattern. Fields mapped to the path pattern cannot be
      repeated and must have a primitive (non-message) type.

      Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path
      pattern automatically become (optional) HTTP query
      parameters. Assume the following definition of the request message:

      ```proto
      message GetMessageRequest {
        message SubMessage {
          string subfield = 1;
        }
        string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
        int64 revision = 2;    // becomes a parameter
        SubMessage sub = 3;    // `sub.subfield` becomes a parameter
      }
      ```

      This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:

      HTTP | RPC
      -----|-----
      `GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&sub.subfield=foo` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456" revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield: "foo"))`

      Note that fields which are mapped to HTTP parameters must have a
      primitive type or a repeated primitive type. Message types are not
      allowed. In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be
      repeated in the URL, as in `...?param=A&param=B`.

      For HTTP method kinds which allow a request body, the `body` field
      specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the
      message resource collection:

      ```proto
      service Messaging {
        rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
          option (google.api.http) = {
            put: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            body: "message"
          };
        }
      }
      message UpdateMessageRequest {
        string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL
        Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body
      }
      ```

      The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the
      representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by
      protos JSON encoding:

      HTTP | RPC
      -----|-----
      `PUT /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" message { text: "Hi!" })`

      The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that
      every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the
      request body.  This enables the following alternative definition of
      the update method:

      ```proto
      service Messaging {
        rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {
          option (google.api.http) = {
            put: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            body: "*"
          };
        }
      }
      message Message {
        string message_id = 1;
        string text = 2;
      }
      ```

      The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:

      HTTP | RPC
      -----|-----
      `PUT /v1/messages/123456 { "text": "Hi!" }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: "123456" text: "Hi!")`

      Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to
      have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in
      the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice of
      defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods
      which don't use the URL at all for transferring data.

      It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using
      the `additional_bindings` option. Example:

      ```proto
      service Messaging {
        rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {
          option (google.api.http) = {
            get: "/v1/messages/{message_id}"
            additional_bindings {
              get: "/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}"
            }
          };
        }
      }
      message GetMessageRequest {
        string message_id = 1;
        string user_id = 2;
      }
      ```

      This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC
      mappings:

      HTTP | RPC
      -----|-----
      `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: "123456")`
      `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: "me" message_id: "123456")`

      # Rules for HTTP mapping

      The rules for mapping HTTP path, query parameters, and body fields
      to the request message are as follows:

      1. The `body` field specifies either `*` or a field path, or is
         omitted. If omitted, it assumes there is no HTTP body.
      2. Leaf fields (recursive expansion of nested messages in the
         request) can be classified into three types:
          (a) Matched in the URL template.
          (b) Covered by body (if body is `*`, everything except (a) fields;
              else everything under the body field)
          (c) All other fields.
      3. URL query parameters found in the HTTP request are mapped to (c) fields.
      4. Any body sent with an HTTP request can contain only (b) fields.

      The syntax of the path template is as follows:

          Template = "/" Segments [ Verb ] ;
          Segments = Segment { "/" Segment } ;
          Segment  = "*" | "**" | LITERAL | Variable ;
          Variable = "{" FieldPath [ "=" Segments ] "}" ;
          FieldPath = IDENT { "." IDENT } ;
          Verb     = ":" LITERAL ;

      The syntax `*` matches a single path segment. It follows the semantics of
      [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String
      Expansion.

      The syntax `**` matches zero or more path segments. It follows the semantics
      of [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.3 Reserved
      Expansion.

      The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path.

      The syntax `Variable` matches the entire path as specified by its template;
      this nested template must not contain further variables. If a variable
      matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}`
      is equivalent to `{var=*}`.

      NOTE: the field paths in variables and in the `body` must not refer to
      repeated fields or map fields.

      Use CustomHttpPattern to specify any HTTP method that is not included in the
      `pattern` field, such as HEAD, or "*" to leave the HTTP method unspecified for
      a given URL path rule. The wild-card rule is useful for services that provide
      content to Web (HTML) clients.

          The unit in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable

          supported units are a subset of [The Unified Code for Units of
          Measure](http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:

          **Basic units (UNIT)**

          * `bit`   bit
          * `By`    byte
          * `s`     second
          * `min`   minute
          * `h`     hour
          * `d`     day

          **Prefixes (PREFIX)**

          * `k`     kilo    (10**3)
          * `M`     mega    (10**6)
          * `G`     giga    (10**9)

          * `Gi`    gibi    (2**30)
          * `Ti`    tebi    (2**40)

          **Grammar**

          The grammar includes the dimensionless unit `1`, such as `1/s`.

          The grammar also includes these connectors:

          * `/`    division (as an infix operator, e.g. `1/s`).
          * `.`    multiplication (as an infix operator, e.g. `GBy.d`)

          The grammar for a unit is as follows:

              Expression = Component { "." Component } { "/" Component } ;

              Component = [ PREFIX ] UNIT [ Annotation ]
                        | Annotation
                        | "1"
                        ;

              Annotation = "{" NAME "}" ;

          Notes:

          * `Annotation` is just a comment if it follows a `UNIT` and is
             equivalent to `1` if it is used alone. For examples,
             `{requests}/s == 1/s`, `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`.
          * `NAME` is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not
             containing '{' or '}'.

          URL-encoded.  All user-defined metric types have the DNS name
          `custom.googleapis.com`.  Metric types should use a natural hierarchical
          grouping. Following are some sample metric types:

              "compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/utilization"
              "compute.googleapis.com/instance/disk/read_ops_count"

          metric type. For example, the
          `compute.googleapis.com/instance/network/received_bytes_count` metric type
          has a label, `loadbalanced`, that specifies whether the traffic was
          received through a load balanced IP address.

    description: |-
      Declares an API to be included in this API. The including API must
      redeclare all the methods from the included API, but documentation
      and options are inherited as follows:

      - If after comment and whitespace stripping, the documentation
        string of the redeclared method is empty, it will be inherited
        from the original method.

      - Each annotation belonging to the service config (http,
        visibility) which is not set in the redeclared method will be
        inherited.

      - If an http annotation is inherited, the path pattern will be
        modified as follows. Any version prefix will be replaced by the
        version of the including API plus the root path if specified.

      Example of a simple mixin:

          package google.acl.v1;
          service AccessControl {
            // Get the underlying ACL object.
            rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
              option (google.api.http).get = "/v1/{resource=**}:getAcl";
            }
          }

          package google.storage.v2;
          service Storage {
            //       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl);

            // Get a data record.
            rpc GetData(GetDataRequest) returns (Data) {
              option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}";
            }
          }

      Example of a mixin configuration:

          apis:
          - name: google.storage.v2.Storage
            mixins:
            - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl

      The mixin construct implies that all methods in `AccessControl` are
      also declared with same name and request/response types in
      `Storage`. A documentation generator or annotation processor will
      see the effective `Storage.GetAcl` method after inherting
      documentation and annotations as follows:

          service Storage {
            // Get the underlying ACL object.
            rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
              option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}:getAcl";
            }
            ...
          }

      Note how the version in the path pattern changed from `v1` to `v2`.

      If the `root` field in the mixin is specified, it should be a
      relative path under which inherited HTTP paths are placed. Example:

          apis:
          - name: google.storage.v2.Storage
            mixins:
            - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl
              root: acls

      This implies the following inherited HTTP annotation:

          service Storage {
            // Get the underlying ACL object.
            rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
              option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/acls/{resource=**}:getAcl";
            }
            ...

          The list of publicly documented OAuth scopes that are allowed access. An

          Example:

               canonical_scopes: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar,
                                 https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.read
    description: |-
      OAuth scopes are a way to define data and permissions on data. For example,
      there are scopes defined for "Read-only access to Google Calendar" and
      "Access to Cloud Platform". Users can consent to a scope for an application,
      giving it permission to access that data on their behalf.

      OAuth scope specifications should be fairly coarse grained; a user will need
      to see and understand the text description of what your scope means.

      In most cases: use one or at most two OAuth scopes for an entire family of
      products. If your product has multiple APIs, you should probably be sharing
      the OAuth scope across all of those APIs.

      When you need finer grained OAuth consent screens: talk with your product
      management about how developers will use them in practice.

      Please note that even though each of the canonical scopes is enough for a
      request to be accepted and passed to the backend, a request can still fail
      due to the backend requiring additional scopes or permissions.

      Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to
      specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.


      A `Policy` consists of a list of `bindings`. A `Binding` binds a list of
      `members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups,
      Google domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions
      defined by IAM.

    description: |-
      The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
      programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
      [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:

      - Simple to use and understand for most users
      - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs

      # Overview

      The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
      and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
      google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
      error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
      developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
      error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
      localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
      information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
      in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error conditions.

      # Language mapping

      The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
      is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
      exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
      mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
      in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.

      # Other uses

      The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
      environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
      consistent developer experience across different environments.

      Example uses of this error model include:

      - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
          it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
          errors.

      - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
          have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.

      - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
          `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
          each error sub-response.

      - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
          results in its response, the status of those operations should be
          represented directly using the `Status` message.

      - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
          be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

      A system parameter is a special kind of parameter defined by the API
      system, not by an individual API. It is typically mapped to an HTTP header
      and/or a URL query parameter. This configuration specifies which methods
      change the names of the system parameters.

      `Visibility` defines restrictions for the visibility of service

      (e.g., TRUSTED_TESTER) that are elsewhere linked to users and projects.

      Users and projects can have access to more than one visibility label. The
      effective visibility for multiple labels is the union of each label's
      elements, plus any unrestricted elements.

      If an element and its parents have no restrictions, visibility is
      unconditionally granted.

          them can break clients.

          Example:

              visibility:
                rules:
                - selector: google.calendar.Calendar.EnhancedSearch
                  restriction: GOOGLE_INTERNAL, TRUSTED_TESTER

          Removing GOOGLE_INTERNAL from this restriction will break clients that
          rely on this method and only had access to it through GOOGLE_INTERNAL.
